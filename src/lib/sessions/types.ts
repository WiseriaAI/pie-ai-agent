 *      this record is meaningless. M1-U5's `R10(session-resume)` cold-start
 *      gate scans and clears all `pendingConfirm` fields *before* any other
 *      recovery work, then marks the session as `failed`. So this field
 *      should never be observed across SW lifetimes.
 *
 *   2. **Raw payload at-rest** — the confirm card needs un-redacted args to
 *      let the user make an informed decision (Phase 2.5 binary-channel
 *      invariant: confirm shows raw, panel-step display redacts). The raw
 *      lives in storage for the duration of the pending confirm so that
 *      panel re-mount can re-render the card; on resolve (approve/reject)
 *      the SW immediately scrubs this field.
 *
 * `kind` is the discriminator for the M1-U4 `SessionConfirmRequestMessage`
 * variant family. M1-U1 only declares the placeholder shape — `payload` is
 * `unknown` until M1-U4 fills in concrete shapes per kind.
